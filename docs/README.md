## Development

Before you continue, make sure you have npm installed. Then;

- `npm install`

If you want a mode where if you change the website it automatically rebuilds, run the following command:

- `npm run-script watch`

However, if you just want to solely build the website, run the following command:

- `npm run-script build`
